        <h2>What I do</h2>
        <p>
            I really love programming. Explore new technologies and different ways to solve problems 
            are really fascinating things to me. But, the best part in doing this is to do it alongside other 
            passionate people, helping each other to grow together. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal is to keep enhancing my developer skills -  and if I could help you do the same,
            I'd be very happy. 
        </p>
